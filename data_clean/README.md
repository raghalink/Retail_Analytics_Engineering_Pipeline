# Cleaned Data

This folder stores the **output files generated by the ETL pipeline**.

## What This Folder Contains
- Structured, validated, and analysis-ready CSV files  
- Combined and standardized order-product tables  
- Columns with corrected datatypes  
- Removal of fields not needed for analytics (e.g., `eval_set = 'test'`)  
- Any preprocessing required before loading into PostgreSQL

## Purpose
These files serve as the input for:
- PostgreSQL schema creation  
- SQL transformation layer (views, materialized views)  
- dbt staging and intermediate models  
- Power BI dashboards (DirectQuery)

No files in this folder are edited manually.  
They are **fully generated outputs** of the ETL process.
